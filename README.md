I time boxed myself to a couple hours, I just have a lot to do lately.

I didn't do the following items:

- Clicking 'new conversation' allows you to create a conversation with one or more other
users from a pre-populated list consisting of no less than 6 users.
- Each conversation should have a unique URL that loads in a browser.
